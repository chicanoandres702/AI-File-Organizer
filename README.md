# AI-Powered Intelligent File Management

## Project Description
This project will develop an AI-powered file management system to automatically tag, categorize, and intelligently name files. This will help users effortlessly organize and access their digital assets. The system will utilize AI algorithms to analyze file content (documents, images, videos) and assign relevant tags and categories, suggest intelligent file names based on content and user habits, and personalize organization based on user preferences. This system aims to improve how individuals and organizations manage their digital assets by reducing the time spent searching for files and improving overall organization efficiency.

## Goals & Objectives
- 1. Develop and train AI models for accurate tagging, categorization, and intelligent file naming within 3 months.
- 2. Build a user-friendly web application interface for interacting with the system within 4 months.
- 3. Achieve a user adoption rate of at least 70% within 6 months of launch.
- 4. Reduce file search time by an average of 50% based on user feedback within the first year.
- 5. Maintain an accuracy rate of at least 90% for AI-powered tagging and categorization.

## Scope
### Included
- Automatic tagging and categorization of files based on content.
- Intelligent file naming suggestions based on user habits and content.
- Personalized organization based on user preferences.
- User-friendly web interface for interacting with the system.
- API for integration with other applications.

### Excluded
- Integration with existing platforms (operating systems, productivity suites) in the initial release.
- Advanced search capabilities (semantic search, natural language processing) in the initial release.
- Cross-device synchronization in the initial release.
